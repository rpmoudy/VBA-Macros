The following portfolio is of some of the automated drafting/design programming I did for work. The actual program file has a ".swp" file extension which can only be opened by SolidWorks software. I compiled the user guides into a PDF document instead. The guides are very informal since they are only shared amongst my coworkers regarding either new processes or what's changed to an existing process. I do not feel comfortable posting the entire codebase documentation that our company uses and only am sharing a small part of what I've done in the past.
